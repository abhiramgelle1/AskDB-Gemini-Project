acs_demographics,"American Community Survey (ACS) 5-year extract for population and demographics data (all columns TEXT). Column groups: Geo_* are geographic identifiers (e.g., Geo__geoid_, Geo_GEO_ID, Geo_qname, Geo_STATE, Geo_COUNTY, Geo_TRACT, etc.). ACS23_5yr_* fields are estimates for specific ACS tables (e.g., B01001* population tables). Fields ending with 's' are standard errors for the corresponding estimate. Treat empty string '' and single dot '.' as NULL. For numeric work, cast with NULLIF e.g., NULLIF(NULLIF(acs_col,''),'.')::numeric. Primary identifiers: Geo__geoid_ (compact ID) and Geo_GEO_ID (prefixed). Can join with states table via Geo_STUSAB=state_code or Geo_STATE=state_fips. Can join with counties via Geo_STATE=state_fips AND Geo_COUNTY=county_fips."
acs_housing,"American Community Survey (ACS) 5-year extract for housing and economic data (all columns TEXT), similar layout to acs_demographics. Use Geo_* columns to filter geographies (state/county/tract/block group) and ACS23_5yr_* columns for metrics. 's' suffix columns are standard errors. Cast text to numeric via NULLIF for math. Prefer filtering by Geo_STUSAB (state code), Geo_STATE (FIPS), Geo_COUNTY (FIPS), Geo_TRACT, Geo_BLKGRP, or by Geo_CBSA (metro) when relevant. Can join with states table via Geo_STUSAB=state_code. Can join with counties via Geo_STATE=state_fips AND Geo_COUNTY=county_fips. Can join with metro_areas via Geo_CBSA=cbsa_code."
states,"Reference table for US states. Contains state_code (2-letter abbreviation like 'GA'), state_name (full name), state_fips (2-digit FIPS code), region, and division. Join with ACS tables using Geo_STUSAB=state_code or Geo_STATE=state_fips. Useful for filtering or grouping ACS data by state names or regions."
counties,"Reference table for US counties. Contains state_fips, county_fips (3-digit), county_name, and state_code. Primary key is (state_fips, county_fips). Join with ACS tables using Geo_STATE=state_fips AND Geo_COUNTY=county_fips. Useful for getting county names when ACS data only has FIPS codes."
metro_areas,"Reference table for Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSA). Contains cbsa_code (Census Bureau Statistical Area code), cbsa_name (metro area name), metro_micro (Metropolitan or Micropolitan), and state_codes (comma-separated list). Join with ACS tables using Geo_CBSA=cbsa_code. Useful for analyzing data by metropolitan areas."
